# Personal-Website
This is basically a repository to host my personal website out of using GitHub pages and automatic deployment. Also so I can learn about automated testing...

THIS WEBSITE IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND NOT COMPLETE SO PLEASE JUST SKIP FOR NOW!!!!

(The only reason this is public is because I didn't feel like paying to host the website from a private repository....)
